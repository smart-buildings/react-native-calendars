# React Native Calendars - Smart Forked Version ✨ 🗓️ 📆

Make your changes in branch `feature/smart-modifications`. To have as few merge conflicts as possible, we better not make formatting or linting fixes.

In case you want to sync this fork with the [original](https://github.com/wix/react-native-calendars) repository, (maybe they've fixed a major bug, or added a new feature):

1. Create a remote so we can reference their repo:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/wix/react-native-calendars.git
```

2. Fetch their repo including their tags:
```
git fetch upstream —all
```

3. Make sure you're on the right branch:
```
git checkout feature/smart-modifications
```

4. Merge the new version.
They create a `tag` along with every release. So if you want to update this fork to a newer version (e.g. `v.1.22.0`), you can access the code using a tag named `v.1.22.0`.
```
git merge v1.22.0
```
